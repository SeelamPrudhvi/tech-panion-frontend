          <p>
            You can search for documents and folders, in the{" "}
            <a href="#">Search Pane</a>, by assigned template, field value, or
            multiple field values, using the field search type.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <a href="#">Quick Search</a> and <a href="#">Basic Search</a>{" "}
            types also let you search across all fields in the repository. Or,
            increase the power of your searches by using the{" "}
            <a href="#">advanced fields and templates search syntax</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To specify a field and value to search for, type the value you want
            to search for in the field. The search values you can input depend
            on the field type and any constraints on the field. For instance,
            you cannot search for alphabet characters in a number field, and if
            an administrator has constrained the phone number format that can be
            typed in a phone number field, you will not be able to type the
            number in a non-matching format. Likewise, when performing a Date,
            Time or Date/Time search, you will only be able to input date and
            time values that match the date and time formatting for that field.
          </p>
          <p>
            When searching on a date fiel, you can search for a date range.
